## I need your help!

I want to move from current hosting provider to more privacy-friendly alternative. If any UI designer can help me with reproducing design to work as a static page without JavaScript, please open an Issue.

## Roadmap

- Move from Framer to privacy-friendly alternative (self hosting) [priority]
- Add page with alternatives to popular services (integration with https://github.com/Arturro43/privacy-links?).
- Enhance UI/UX, especially for mobile users.
- Add more languages.
